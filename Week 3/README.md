# Week 3 Exercise

This week's exercise is to recreate a landing page prototype with React.

This mockup was designed by Saber Ali, Najmul Hasan and Tahsinul Mahmud and can be found at https://www.behance.net/gallery/118083883/Ecommerce-UI-Kit-%28Free-Download%29.

I have created a modified version of it which you can access here: https://www.figma.com/file/jGK8akSFOoVMjWljxfPobr/Project---Hekto?node-id=1%3A38.

You will be specifically recreating the Home Page (up until the marked point). The React starter app has already been set up for you in the `hekto` folder. I've also provided the images (i.e. the furniture) that you'll need in the `images` folder.
